## Fracture Detection from X-ray Images using Vision Transformers (ViT)

This project leverages deep learning and state-of-the-art Vision Transformer (ViT) models to classify bone X-ray images as **fractured** or **healthy**. It is designed to assist in early diagnosis and medical image analysis using AI-based image classification.

---

## Project Overview

The model is trained on a dataset of labeled bone X-ray images. The images were preprocessed and classified using ViT-based architectures from the Hugging Face Transformers library.

-  Task: Binary Classification (Fractured / Healthy)
-  Model: `google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k`
-  Data: Pre-classified X-ray images
-  Frameworks: PyTorch, Transformers, Datasets
-  Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, AUC

##  How It Works

1. **Preprocessing:**  
   - Images resized to 224Ã—224 (ViT input format)  
   - Converted to RGB and normalized  

2. **Feature Extraction:**  
   - Used ViT, DeiT, Swin, Beit, ConvNext feature extractors from Hugging Face  

3. **Model Training:**  
   - Fine-tuned pre-trained ViT model on X-ray dataset  
   - Training done using `Trainer` API  

4. **Evaluation Metrics:**  
   - Accuracy  
   - Precision  
   - Recall  
   - F1-Score  
   - AUC
